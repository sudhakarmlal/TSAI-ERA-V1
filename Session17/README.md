# Building a Single Model file  Combining ViT, GPT, and BERT Elements

## Introduction

In this project, we've developed a unified model file that combines elements from three powerful pre-trained architectures: Vision Transformer (ViT), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This model file can handle both text and image data, making it versatile for a wide range of natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

## Code Structure and Components

### Configurations

1. **Configurations:**

   We start by defining a `Config` class, which holds various hyperparameters and configuration settings. These settings include the name of the model, the number of code layers, the number of attention heads, embedding sizes, inner feedforward sizes, the number of embeddings, sequence length, and dropout rates.

2. **Encoder Blocks:**

   The `encoder_block` function creates an encoder block using PyTorch's `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`. These blocks are essential components of both GPT and BERT architectures, contributing to the model's capacity to learn from sequential data.

3. **Positional Embedding:**

   The `PositionalEmbedding` class generates positional embeddings, a crucial component for understanding the order of elements in sequences. It uses a mathematical formulation to create embeddings for each position in a sequence.

4. **Transformer Model:**

   The `Transformer` class is the heart of our unified model. It encapsulates the core components of BERT and GPT models based on the selected configuration. Key elements include:

   - Token embeddings (`wte`) and positional embeddings (`wpe`), which encode input tokens and their positions.
   - A stack of encoder blocks (`h`) to process input data effectively. The number of blocks is determined by the `n_code` parameter.
   - Layer normalization (`ln_f`) to stabilize training.

   Additionally, the class includes the capability to generate new tokens and calculate the number of model parameters.

5. **Patch Embedding:**

   We introduce a `PatchEmbedding` class that transforms 2D input images into a 1D sequence of learnable embedding vectors. This class plays a critical role in the Vision Transformer (ViT) part of our unified model, allowing it to process image data effectively. The `PatchEmbedding` class involves:

   - Convolutional patching of the input image to extract features.
   - Flattening of patch feature maps into a single dimension.
   - Proper reshaping of the output tensor to match the desired dimensions.

6. **ViT Configuration:**

   The `Vit_Config` class defines configuration settings specific to the Vision Transformer (ViT) part of the model. These settings include image size, patch size, the number of transformer layers, embedding dimensions, dropout rates, and more.

7. **Vision Transformer (ViT) Model:**

   Finally, we build the Vision Transformer (ViT) component of our unified model using the `Vision_Transformer` class. This class integrates the following components:

   - Class and position embeddings.
   - Transformer encoder blocks.
   - An embedding dropout layer.
   - The patch embedding mechanism, using the `PatchEmbedding` class.
   - A classifier for making predictions.
